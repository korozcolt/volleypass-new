# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sistema de Setup Superadmin is a foundational feature that provides a comprehensive initial configuration wizard for VolleyPass. This system enables superadministrators to configure all essential system settings through an intuitive, step-by-step graphical interface. The feature ensures that the system is properly configured before any leagues or users can begin using the platform, establishing the base configuration for branding, regional settings, volleyball rules, and default categories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a superadministrator, I want to configure the basic application information through a guided wizard, so that the system reflects our organization's branding and identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the superadmin accesses the system for the first time THEN the system SHALL redirect to the setup wizard
2. WHEN the superadmin completes the basic information step THEN the system SHALL save application name, logo, primary colors, and secondary colors
3. WHEN the superadmin uploads a logo THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview and validate file format and size
4. WHEN the superadmin selects colors THEN the system SHALL provide a color picker interface and show live preview

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a superadministrator, I want to configure contact and regional information, so that the system operates with correct timezone, currency, and contact details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the superadmin enters contact information THEN the system SHALL validate email format and phone number format
2. WHEN the superadmin selects timezone THEN the system SHALL update all system timestamps accordingly
3. WHEN the superadmin selects currency THEN the system SHALL default to COP but allow other currency selection
4. WHEN contact information is saved THEN the system SHALL use this information for all system communications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a superadministrator, I want to configure default volleyball rules and categories, so that leagues can start with standardized, regulation-compliant settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the superadmin configures volleyball rules THEN the system SHALL provide options for sets per match (3 or 5), points per set, and rotation rules
2. WHEN the superadmin reviews default categories THEN the system SHALL display standard volleyball age categories (Pre-Infantil through Master)
3. WHEN the superadmin modifies category age ranges THEN the system SHALL validate that ranges don't overlap and are logical
4. WHEN volleyball rules are saved THEN the system SHALL apply these as defaults for all new leagues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a superadministrator, I want the wizard to save progress automatically and provide validation feedback, so that I don't lose work and can correct errors immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the superadmin completes any wizard step THEN the system SHALL automatically save the data
2. WHEN the superadmin navigates between steps THEN the system SHALL preserve all previously entered data
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
4. WHEN the superadmin returns to the wizard THEN the system SHALL resume from the last incomplete step

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a superadministrator, I want to review all configuration before finalizing, so that I can ensure all settings are correct before system activation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the superadmin reaches the final step THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive summary of all configuration
2. WHEN the superadmin reviews the summary THEN the system SHALL allow editing any section by returning to the relevant step
3. WHEN the superadmin confirms the final configuration THEN the system SHALL mark setup as completed and activate the system
4. WHEN setup is completed THEN the system SHALL prevent unauthorized access to the setup wizard

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the system to enforce setup completion, so that the platform cannot be used in an unconfigured state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses the system before setup completion THEN the system SHALL redirect to the setup wizard or show setup pending message
2. WHEN a non-superadmin user attempts to access the setup wizard THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect appropriately
3. WHEN setup is incomplete THEN the system SHALL disable all non-essential functionality
4. WHEN setup is completed THEN the system SHALL enable full functionality for all authorized users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a superadministrator, I want to modify system configuration after initial setup, so that I can update settings as organizational needs change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the superadmin accesses configuration after initial setup THEN the system SHALL provide access to modify any configuration section
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL create a backup of previous settings
3. WHEN critical settings are modified THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and show impact warnings
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL log all changes for audit purposes
