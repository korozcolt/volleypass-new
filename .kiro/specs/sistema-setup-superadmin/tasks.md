  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 4. Build SystemSetupResource Filament wizard
  - Create SystemSetupResource extending Filament Resource with wizard-based form structure
  - Implement 7-step wizard: Basic Info, Contact Info, Regional Config, Volleyball Rules, Categories, Admin Users, Final Review
  - Add step navigation, progress indicators, and step validation using Filament form components
  - Implement wizard state management and step transition logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Create custom Filament components
  - Create SetupWizardStep component for individual wizard steps with title, description, and completion status
  - Create ColorPickerField component with live preview and predefined color palette
  - Create LogoUploaderField component with image preview, dimension validation, and format restrictions
  - Create ConfigurationPreview component for displaying real-time configuration summary
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.1_

- [ ] 6. Implement step-specific validation and forms
  - Create validation request classes for each wizard step (BasicInfoRequest, ContactInfoRequest, etc.)
  - Implement real-time validation with user-friendly error messages
  - Add cross-step validation to ensure configuration consistency
  - Create form schemas for each step with appropriate field types and validation rules
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 7. Build configuration persistence and preview system
  - Implement auto-save functionality that saves progress after each step completion
  - Create configuration backup system before making changes
  - Build comprehensive configuration preview showing all settings with edit links
  - Implement final review step with complete configuration summary and confirmation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 7.2_

- [ ] 8. Create setup completion and activation system
  - Implement setup completion logic that validates all required configuration
  - Create system activation process that enables full functionality after setup
  - Add setup completion notifications and confirmation messages
  - Implement post-setup dashboard with configuration overview and quick edit access
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 6.4, 7.3_

- [ ] 9. Implement error handling and recovery
  - Create comprehensive error handling for validation failures and system errors
  - Implement setup rollback functionality to return to previous steps
  - Add graceful error recovery with user-friendly error messages
  - Create setup reset functionality for development and testing purposes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 7.1, 7.4_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for all service classes (SystemSetupService, DefaultDataService, SetupValidationService)
  - Create feature tests for complete wizard flow including step transitions and validation
  - Write integration tests for middleware functionality and access control
  - Create component tests for custom Filament components and form validation
  - _Requirements: All requirements covered through comprehensive testing_

- [ ] 11. Add documentation and deployment preparation
  - Create technical documentation for setup system architecture and components
  - Write user guide for superadmin setup process with screenshots and step-by-step instructions
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common setup issues and their resolutions
  - Prepare deployment scripts and configuration for production environment
  - _Requirements: 7.4_
